# JADE
JADE is a Julia DOASA Environment.
It is a flexible version of DOASA, written in Julia,
which utilises stochastic dual dynamic programming to find optimal hydro release policies
in electricity markets.

The Electricity Authority hosts a repository of JADE input files.
These can be accessed from the [EMI website](https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Wholesale/Tools/Jade). Any input files in the
JADE Github repository are for testing purposes only.

## Documentation
A detailed description of the inputs and outputs to JADE and how to use JADE can be
found in the JADE [user documentation](https://github.com/EPOC-NZ/JADE/raw/main/docs/JADE%20documentation.pdf),
and the [API documentation](https://EPOC-NZ.github.io/JADE.jl).

# Stockpile model  
The stockpile model was created by Ba Trieu Minh Nguyen at the University of Auckland to model how much should we purchase the stockpile by adding a new model to it. It is run with steady-state.
## How to run Stockpile model:
Set `alpha` in `model.jl` to be 1 and change `runJADE.jl` to test1/run4. Change how many times you want to train and simulate in `runJADE/Input/test1/run4.csv`
