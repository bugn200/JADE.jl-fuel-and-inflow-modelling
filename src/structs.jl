This function constructs a DecisionRule object. See the JADE user documentation for
further details. DecisionRules can be applied to spill and generation at hydro stations,
these are both measured in MWh.

### Required Arguments
`slope` is the slope, w.r.t. the current storage in `reservoir`, of the (linear) bound applied
to generation and / or spill flow corresponding to `station`. Units are MWh / Mm³.

`intercept` is the bound applied to generation and / or spill flow corresponding to `station`
when `reservoir` is at 0 storage.  Units are (MWh).

`boundtype` is set to `:upper`, `:lower`, or `:equality` depending on how the flow should be
restricted.

`station` is the hydro station that the decision rule restricts.

`reservoir` is the hydro reservoir whose  affects the bound applied.

`flowtype` is set to `:generation`, `:spill`, or `:combined`.

`weeks` defines the weeks in the year that the decision rule is in effect. E.g. [1:10,43:52].

An object containing JADE simulation settings.

`sim_dir::String` is the folder that the simulation output should be written to (`Output/<data_dir>/<policy_dir>/<sim_dir>`).

`sim_type::Symbol` is the type of simulation, either `:monte_carlo` or `:historical`.

`sim_years::Union{Nothing,Vector{Int}}` is either `nothing` or a vector of years that should be sampled from in the simulation.

`randomize_years::Bool` if `true` the simulation will randomly choose years from `sim_years` (with replacement); otherwise the simulation sequentially samples the years from `sim_years` (in this case replications is automatically set).

`reset_starting_levels::Union{Symbol,Bool}` if `true` the simulation will reset the initial storage levels after each iteration, even for steady-state models.

`number_of_cycles::Int` for steady-state models, if this is greater than 1, each replication of the simulation will run `number_of_cycles` times; `reset_starting_levels` must be set to `true`.

`initial_stage::Int` is the stage (not the week) of the simulation that the simulation will start from.

`initial_state::Union{Nothing,Dict{String,Float64}}` is the initial state variables in the `initial stage`

`random_seed::Int` is the random seed for the simulation.
